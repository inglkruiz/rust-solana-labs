✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

### Apps

- [client/hello-world](apps/client/hello-world/README.md): Client application borrowed from the [solana-labs/example-helloworld](https://www.github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld) repository. It's wrapped in a NestJS standalone application.
- [rust/http-server](apps/rust/http-server/README.md): Rust HTTP server application. Custom minimal HTTP server for understanding the basics of Rust.

### Libs

- [program/hello-world](libs/program/hello-world/README.md): Solana smart contract program. Borrowed from the [solana-labs/example-helloworld](https://www.github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld) repository. I preferred not to use the repository since I'm building a curated list of examples for myself powered by Nx monorepo.
